1. Make sure that Git is installed and setup correctly on your machine. If not, follow the installation instructions in their official website.

2. Clone the repository using the following command:

    ```git
    git clone https://github.com/ivanreeve/webdev-portfolio.git
    ```

3. Use any IDE or text editor you want to open your local copy of the repository. For example, on Visual Studio Code, you need to install an extension called "Go Live" to start a development server. This allows you to view the changes in real time as you edit the files via hot reloading.

    To start the live server on Visual Studio Code, just click the button indicated by the white border with the label "Go Live". This should start the development server right away.
